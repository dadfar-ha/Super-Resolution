# Super-Resolution With GAN/ ESRGAN-LUS
Super-Resolution with Generative Adversarial Networks/ ESRGAN-PLUS


# Quick Start

In this paper, we provide a GAN architecture inspired of ESRGAN.
The changes are dedicated to generator and discriminator. Where we update both structures by adding and removing som layers.
For training and testing, run train-test.py.
for easy acces, run ESRGNA-PLUS.py.
The results have ways to come much better.
